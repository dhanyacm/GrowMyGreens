			Grow my Greens is an initiative of Winning Earth where people are encouraged to invest in their health and their environment by farming and gardening organically. <br>

We all prefer better tasting, more nutritious food that has a lower carbon footprint. Unfortunately in the times we live, we cannot guarantee the same about the food that is commercially available. This is where significance of this healthy, home-grown, local food movement. 
<br>
We are dedicated to preserving the environment by providing you with cost-effective, state-of-the-art, organic growing supplies and the information and tools needed to apply them.
